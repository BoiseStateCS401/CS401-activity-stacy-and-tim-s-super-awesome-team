		<strong>HTML</strong>
		Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating
		web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
		JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide
		Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
		storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
		structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
		the appearance of the document.

		<strong>CSS</strong>

		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the how markup
		code will apear. It is most often used to set the visual style of web
		pages and user interfaces written in HTML, the language can be applied to any
		XML document and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.
		Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most
		websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
		and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

		of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to
		make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.
